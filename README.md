trac-plugin-scheduled
=====================

This plugin implements scheduled and recurring tickets for Trac. It contains
an interface for defining scheduled/delayed and recurring tickets, and
automatically creates new tickets upon cronjob request.

TODO:
* allow setting all ticket settings that would be available for normal tickets
* add more recurring possibilities, like "every x weeks", "the x'th every y months"
* improve "every 1 days" -> "every day"
* improve documentation for future editing
